# Project Progress Status

## Current Status
**Branch**: `develop`  
**Status**: ✅ **Project fully implemented and ready for development**

## Recent Work Completed

### Project Infrastructure (Sept 3-5, 2025)
- ✅ **Complete .NET 9 Aspire implementation** - Full solution with AppHost and test projects
- ✅ **Solution structure** - HippoCamp.sln with proper project organization
- ✅ **Source code implementation** - AppHost.cs with basic Aspire setup
- ✅ **Test framework setup** - xUnit v3 with integration test example
- ✅ **Build configuration** - Directory.Build.props, .editorconfig, global.json
- ✅ **Git-flow governance** - Branch strategy and conventional commits enforced
- ✅ **CI/CD foundation** - Enhanced GitHub Actions with dependabot
- ✅ **AI-assisted development** - Claude Code PM system with agents
- ✅ **Documentation** - Comprehensive README and WARP.md development guide

### Recent Commits
- `4a316c4` - feat: complete project initialization with .NET 9 Aspire setup (#3)
- `66dfd28` - feat: add PR validation workflow with established tools  
- `9165128` - feat: initial commit with README

## Current Work Items

### Untracked Changes
- `.claude/` directory - PM system and agent configurations  
- `AGENTS.md` - Documentation for AI agents
- `CLAUDE.md` - Project instructions for AI assistance
- `COMMANDS.md` - Reference for available PM commands

## Immediate Next Steps

### High Priority
1. **Commit PM system files** - Add .claude/, AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, COMMANDS.md to repo
2. **Begin feature development** - Start implementing actual business logic
3. **Create first feature branch** - Follow git-flow for new functionality
4. **Run initial tests** - Verify the test framework is working correctly

### Development Pipeline
- Authentication service implementation
- Database integration with Entity Framework
- API endpoint development
- Frontend component scaffolding (if applicable)

## Blockers & Dependencies
- **None currently identified** - Project foundation is solid
- All dependencies (.NET 9, Aspire, Docker) are properly configured
- Development environment is fully operational

## Quality Metrics
- **Build Status**: ✅ Clean builds
- **Test Coverage**: ✅ Framework ready (no application tests yet)
- **Code Quality**: ✅ EditorConfig and style guides enforced
- **Documentation**: ✅ Comprehensive setup and workflow docs

## Branch Strategy Status
- **main**: Production baseline with initial commit
- **develop**: Current branch with complete implementation
- **feature branches**: Ready to be created for new functionality  
- **Next**: Begin feature development with proper branching strategy

## Key Decisions Made
1. **Microsoft Aspire** chosen for cloud-native orchestration
2. **Issue-driven development** enforced for all changes
3. **Conventional commits** with squash merge strategy
4. **xUnit v3** with Microsoft Testing Platform for modern testing
5. **AI-assisted development** with Claude Code integrated workflows

## Update History
- 2025-09-05T01:08:54Z: Major milestone - complete .NET 9 Aspire implementation deployed, all project files created, switched to develop branch, updated status to reflect full implementation
- 2025-09-05T01:03:14Z: Updated branch status (feature branch merged to main), corrected project structure status (directories exist but .csproj files not created yet), updated immediate next steps to reflect actual current needs
