# PRD: Memory Store

## Executive Summary

The Memory Store is a standalone microservice designed to provide long-term persistent storage for AI agents working on coding projects. It serves as the "memory bank" that allows AI agents to store, retrieve, and build upon past interactions, decisions, and learned context across multiple development sessions. The service focuses on storing embeddings with associated metadata to enable semantic search and context retrieval for enhanced AI-assisted development workflows.

## Problem Statement

### Current Problem
AI agents in coding projects currently lack persistent memory across sessions, leading to:
- **Context Loss**: Each new session starts from scratch, losing valuable project history and decisions
- **Repeated Learning**: AI agents must re-learn project patterns and conventions in every interaction
- **Inconsistent Assistance**: Without memory of past interactions, AI assistance becomes fragmented and inconsistent
- **Lost Insights**: Valuable architectural decisions, bug patterns, and optimization insights are lost between sessions

### Why This Matters Now
- AI-assisted development is becoming increasingly sophisticated and context-dependent
- Development teams need consistent, evolving AI assistance that learns and improves over time
- Long-running projects benefit significantly from AI agents that remember past decisions and patterns
- The HippoCamp foundation provides the perfect orchestration platform for this memory service
