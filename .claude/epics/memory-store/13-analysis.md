# Analysis for Task #13: Database Setup and Configuration

## Overview
Task #13 involves setting up PostgreSQL database infrastructure with Entity Framework Core and vector extensions. Despite being marked as `parallel: false`, this task contains multiple independent work streams that can be developed in parallel once the basic database instance is established. The task spans infrastructure setup, EF configuration, performance optimization, and security implementation.

## Parallel Work Streams

### Stream A: Database Infrastructure Setup
**Focus**: Core PostgreSQL setup and vector extension configuration
**Agent Type**: general-purpose
**Files**: 
- `src/HippoCamp.MemoryStore/appsettings.json`
- `src/HippoCamp.MemoryStore/appsettings.Development.json`
- `src/HippoCamp.MemoryStore/appsettings.Production.json`
- `docker-compose.yml` (database services)
- Database initialization scripts

**Work Description**:
Establish PostgreSQL database instance with proper vector extension support (pgvector). Configure connection strings for different environments and ensure database accessibility. This includes Docker/container setup for development and production deployment configurations.

**Dependencies**: None (foundational)
**Effort**: Medium (M)
**Priority**: High (blocking)

### Stream B: Entity Framework Core Configuration
**Focus**: EF Core setup, DbContext, and connection management
**Agent Type**: code-analyzer
**Files**: 
- `src/HippoCamp.MemoryStore/Data/MemoryDbContext.cs`
- `src/HippoCamp.MemoryStore/Data/DbContextExtensions.cs`
- `src/HippoCamp.MemoryStore/Program.cs` (EF registration)
- `src/HippoCamp.MemoryStore/HippoCamp.MemoryStore.csproj` (NuGet packages)

**Work Description**:
Configure Entity Framework Core with PostgreSQL provider, implement database context with proper entity configurations, and set up connection string management. Include connection pooling configuration and EF Core service registration.

**Dependencies**: Stream A (connection strings)
**Effort**: Medium (M)
**Priority**: High

### Stream C: Migration and Versioning System
**Focus**: Database schema migration infrastructure
**Agent Type**: code-analyzer
**Files**: 
- `src/HippoCamp.MemoryStore/Migrations/` (directory structure)
- `src/HippoCamp.MemoryStore/Data/MigrationExtensions.cs`
- Migration scripts and rollback procedures
- Database versioning configuration

**Work Description**:
Establish migration system for database schema changes, implement versioning strategy, create rollback capabilities, and configure migration execution for different environments. Set up automated migration execution during deployment.

**Dependencies**: Stream B (DbContext configured)
**Effort**: Small (S)
**Priority**: Medium

### Stream D: Performance and Health Monitoring
**Focus**: Database performance optimization and health checks
**Agent Type**: general-purpose
**Files**: 
- `src/HippoCamp.MemoryStore/Health/DatabaseHealthCheck.cs`
- `src/HippoCamp.MemoryStore/Configuration/DatabasePerformanceOptions.cs`
- `src/HippoCamp.MemoryStore/Program.cs` (health check registration)
- Performance monitoring and logging configuration

**Work Description**:
Implement database health checks for monitoring, configure performance settings (timeouts, connection limits), set up indexing strategy for embedding operations, and establish database monitoring infrastructure.

**Dependencies**: Stream B (DbContext available)
**Effort**: Small (S)
**Priority**: Low

## Coordination Notes
- Stream A must complete database connectivity before other streams can test their implementations
- Streams B and C have a sequential dependency (migrations need DbContext)
- Stream D can run in parallel with C once B is complete
- All streams should use consistent configuration patterns and environment-specific settings
- Testing should be coordinated to avoid database conflicts during parallel development

## Critical Path
1. **Stream A** (Database Infrastructure) - MUST complete first
2. **Stream B** (Entity Framework Core) - Blocks C and D
3. **Stream C** and **Stream D** can run in parallel after B completes

## Recommended Execution Strategy
1. Start Stream A immediately (single agent focus)
2. Begin Stream B once database connectivity is confirmed
3. Launch Streams C and D in parallel once EF Core context is functional
4. Coordinate testing to ensure no conflicts between parallel streams
