# Stream A: Core Entity Models

## Scope
Implement the Memory entity class with all required properties including embedding support, metadata storage, and proper data annotations. Create the MemoryType enum with all specified types. This is the foundational work that all other streams depend on.

## Files
- `src/HippoCamp.MemoryStore/Models/Memory.cs`
- `src/HippoCamp.MemoryStore/Models/MemoryType.cs`

## Progress
- ✅ Created Memory entity with all required properties
- ✅ Added MemoryType enum with all specified types  
- ✅ Implemented proper data annotations and validation
- ✅ Added performance indexes for key query patterns
- ✅ Integrated pgvector support for embeddings
- ✅ Added JSON metadata support
- ✅ Committed implementation

## Status
Stream A is **COMPLETE**. Other streams (B and C) can now start as they depend on these core entity models.
