# Stream A Progress - Core Memory Service Layer
## Issue #10 - Memory CRUD Operations

### Status: ✅ COMPLETED

### Files Modified/Created:
- ✅ `src/HippoCamp.MemoryStore/Services/IMemoryService.cs` - Created interface with all CRUD operations
- ✅ `src/HippoCamp.MemoryStore/Services/MemoryService.cs` - Implemented service with business validation  
- ✅ `src/HippoCamp.MemoryStore/Models/ApiErrorResponse.cs` - Created standardized error response
- ✅ `src/HippoCamp.MemoryStore/Models/MemoryValidationException.cs` - Custom validation exception
- ✅ `src/HippoCamp.MemoryStore/Models/Memory.cs` - Added IsDeleted & DeletedAt for soft delete
- ✅ `src/HippoCamp.MemoryStore/Validation/EmbeddingValidator.cs` - Fixed Vector ambiguity issue

### Work Completed:

#### Core CRUD Operations ✅
- **Create**: Implemented with embedding validation and business rules
- **Read**: GetById with last accessed timestamp update, GetByProject with filtering
- **Update**: Partial update support with validation
- **Soft Delete**: Set IsDeleted flag with DeletedAt timestamp

#### Validation & Error Handling ✅
- Input validation for all memory fields (content, embeddings, metadata)
- Comprehensive business rule validation in dedicated methods
- Proper HTTP status codes through ApiErrorResponse model
- Embedding dimension validation (50-4096 dimensions)
- Metadata schema validation (max 50 key-value pairs)
- Custom MemoryValidationException for structured error reporting

#### Technical Implementation ✅
- pgvector Vector to float[] conversion for embedding operations
- Comprehensive logging throughout service operations
- Proper cancellation token support
- Entity Framework Core integration with MemoryDbContext
- Async/await patterns with proper error handling

#### Key Features Implemented:
- **Memory Creation**: Full validation with required embedding, project ID, content, type
- **Memory Retrieval**: By ID (with last accessed update) and by project (with deprecated filtering)
- **Memory Updates**: Partial updates with validation, optional last accessed timestamp update
- **Soft Delete**: Logical deletion with retention metadata
- **Embedding Validation**: Dimension checks, finite value validation, range checking
- **Business Rules**: Content length limits, metadata size limits, type validation

### Commit Details:
- **Commit Hash**: 1e64f99
- **Commit Message**: "Issue #10: Implement core memory service layer with CRUD operations"
- **Files Changed**: 6 files, 955+ insertions

### Next Steps:
The core memory service layer is complete and ready for integration with:
- API controllers (for HTTP endpoints)
- Dependency injection setup
- Database migrations for new Memory model properties
- Unit and integration tests

### Notes:
- Fixed compilation issue in EmbeddingValidator.cs (Vector ambiguity)
- Builds successfully with 0 errors, 41 warnings (mostly ConfigureAwait recommendations)
- All assigned scope requirements have been implemented
- Service is ready for immediate use by other components
