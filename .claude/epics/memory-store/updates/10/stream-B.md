# Stream B: Batch Operations Service

## Scope
Implement batch operations service that handles batch create operations, batch update operations with transaction rollback, bulk deprecation by criteria, transaction management, progress reporting, and batch validation.

## Files
- `src/HippoCamp.MemoryStore/Services/IBatchMemoryService.cs` ✅
- `src/HippoCamp.MemoryStore/Services/BatchMemoryService.cs` ✅
- `src/HippoCamp.MemoryStore/DTOs/BatchCreateMemoryDto.cs` ✅
- `src/HippoCamp.MemoryStore/DTOs/BatchOperationResultDto.cs` ✅
- `src/HippoCamp.MemoryStore/MemoryDbContext.cs` ✅ (Updated with Memory DbSet)

## Progress
### Completed ✅
- **Batch DTOs Implementation**: Created comprehensive DTOs for batch operations
  - BatchCreateMemoryDto with validation constraints (max 100 memories)
  - BatchOperationResultDto with detailed success/failure tracking
  - BatchItemError for granular error reporting
  - BatchProgressInfo for real-time progress updates

- **IBatchMemoryService Interface**: Designed complete service contract
  - Batch create operations with progress reporting
  - Batch update operations with transaction support
  - Bulk deprecation by flexible criteria
  - Batch validation without execution
  - Batch status tracking for long-running operations

- **BatchMemoryService Implementation**: Full service implementation with:
  - **Batch Create**: Create up to 100 memories per batch with transaction rollback
  - **Batch Update**: Update multiple memories with atomic transaction support
  - **Bulk Deprecation**: Flexible criteria-based deprecation with metadata filtering
  - **Transaction Management**: Full ACID compliance with automatic rollback on failure
  - **Progress Reporting**: Real-time progress updates for large operations
  - **Comprehensive Validation**: Pre-flight validation with detailed error reporting
  - **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with detailed diagnostics
  - **Cancellation Support**: Full async/await with cancellation token support

- **Database Context**: Updated MemoryDbContext with required Memory DbSet

## Technical Features Implemented
- ✅ Maximum 100 memories per batch constraint
- ✅ Transaction rollback on any validation failure  
- ✅ Progress reporting for large batch operations
- ✅ Flexible bulk deprecation criteria (project, type, date, metadata filters)
- ✅ Comprehensive input validation with DataAnnotations
- ✅ Business logic validation (embedding dimensions, content length)
- ✅ Duplicate detection within batches
- ✅ Async operations with cancellation token support
- ✅ Detailed error reporting with item-level granularity
- ✅ Logging integration for operation tracking
- ✅ Memory-efficient processing for large batches

## Implementation Notes
- All operations use Entity Framework transactions for ACID compliance
- Progress reporting uses concurrent dictionary for thread-safe status tracking
- Validation includes both DataAnnotation validation and custom business rules
- Error handling provides both summary and item-level detail
- Bulk deprecation supports complex metadata filtering
- Memory embeddings handled as Pgvector Vector types for PostgreSQL compatibility
