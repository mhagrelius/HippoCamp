# Task 003: API Infrastructure Setup

## Description
Create the REST API infrastructure including controllers, routing, dependency injection, and basic endpoint structure for the memory-store service. This task establishes the web API layer that will serve all memory operations following HippoCamp conventions and RESTful design principles.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] MemoriesController created with all required endpoints
- [ ] Proper HTTP method mapping (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- [ ] Request/response DTOs properly configured
- [ ] Dependency injection configured for all services
- [ ] API routing follows RESTful conventions
- [ ] Error handling middleware implemented
- [ ] API versioning strategy established
- [ ] OpenAPI/Swagger documentation generated
- [ ] CORS configuration for development
- [ ] Health check endpoints implemented

## Technical Details

### API Endpoints
```
POST   /api/memories                    - Create new memory
GET    /api/memories/search             - Search memories
GET    /api/memories/{id}               - Get memory by ID
PUT    /api/memories/{id}               - Update memory
DELETE /api/memories/{id}               - Delete memory
GET    /api/projects/{projectId}/memories - Get project memories
GET    /api/health                      - Health check
```

### Controller Structure
- MemoriesController with proper action methods
- Async/await patterns for all database operations
- Proper HTTP status code responses
- Request validation using model validation attributes
- Error handling with appropriate HTTP responses

### Dependency Injection
- Register DbContext with proper lifetime
- Configure repository pattern services
- Set up logging dependencies
- Configure validation services
- Register health check services

### Middleware Pipeline
- Exception handling middleware
- Request logging middleware
- CORS middleware for development
- Authentication middleware (placeholder)
- Performance monitoring middleware

### API Documentation
- Configure Swagger/OpenAPI generation
- Document all endpoints with examples
- Set up API versioning headers
- Configure response schema documentation

## Dependencies
- Task 002: Core Data Models and Entities
- ASP.NET Core Web API framework
- Swagger/OpenAPI generation packages
- Logging and monitoring libraries

## Effort Estimate
**Size**: Medium (M)  
**Hours**: 14-18 hours  
**Complexity**: Moderate - standard web API setup with HippoCamp conventions

## Definition of Done
- All API endpoints are implemented and functional
- Controllers follow HippoCamp patterns and conventions
- Dependency injection is properly configured
- API returns appropriate HTTP status codes
- Error handling provides meaningful responses
- Swagger documentation is complete and accurate
- Health checks report service status correctly
- API can be tested using HTTP client tools
- All endpoints validate input properly
- CORS is configured for development scenarios
