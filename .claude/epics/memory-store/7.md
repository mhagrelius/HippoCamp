# Task 007: Aspire Integration and Monitoring

## Description
Configure Aspire orchestration and service registration for the memory-store service, establishing comprehensive observability, logging, and health check capabilities. This task ensures the memory-store service integrates seamlessly with the HippoCamp ecosystem and provides full visibility into service health and performance.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Aspire service registration configured for memory-store API
- [ ] Service discovery working with other HippoCamp services
- [ ] Comprehensive logging configured with structured output
- [ ] Health check endpoints implemented and monitored
- [ ] Observability dashboards created for key metrics
- [ ] Performance monitoring for API endpoints and database operations
- [ ] Resource usage monitoring (CPU, memory, database connections)
- [ ] Alert configurations for critical service issues
- [ ] Distributed tracing for request correlation
- [ ] Configuration management through Aspire

## Technical Details

### Service Registration
- Configure memory-store service in Aspire orchestration
- Set up service discovery for API endpoints
- Implement proper service lifecycle management
- Configure environment-specific service settings

### Observability Stack
- Integrate with Aspire's built-in observability tools
- Configure structured logging with correlation IDs
- Set up metrics collection for API performance
- Implement distributed tracing across service calls
- Create custom metrics for memory operations

### Health Monitoring
- Implement health check endpoints for API and database
- Configure readiness and liveness probes
- Set up dependency health checks (PostgreSQL, external services)
- Create health status aggregation and reporting

### Monitoring Dashboards
- Design dashboards for service performance metrics
- Create visualizations for embedding operations
- Set up database performance monitoring
- Implement user activity and usage analytics
- Configure real-time alerting for critical issues

### Integration Points
- Connect with existing HippoCamp telemetry
- Ensure compatibility with development workflows
- Configure local development monitoring
- Set up production monitoring standards

## Dependencies
- Core API service implementation (Task 002)
- Aspire framework setup in HippoCamp
- PostgreSQL database configuration
- HippoCamp observability infrastructure

## Effort Estimate
**Size**: Medium (M)  
**Hours**: 12-16 hours  
**Complexity**: Moderate - infrastructure integration with monitoring setup

## Definition of Done
- Memory-store service is fully registered with Aspire orchestration
- Service discovery works correctly in all environments
- Comprehensive logging captures all relevant application events
- Health check endpoints respond correctly and provide detailed status
- Monitoring dashboards display real-time service metrics
- Performance monitoring tracks API response times and database operations
- Alert system notifies on critical service issues
- Distributed tracing provides complete request visibility
- Integration follows HippoCamp observability patterns and standards
- Documentation covers monitoring setup and dashboard usage
