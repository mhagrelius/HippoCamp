# Task 001: Database Setup and Configuration

## Description
Configure PostgreSQL database with Entity Framework Core and vector extensions to support embedding storage and semantic search operations. This foundational task sets up the core data infrastructure that all other memory-store functionality depends on.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] PostgreSQL database instance configured and accessible
- [ ] Entity Framework Core setup with proper connection strings
- [ ] Database context created with initial configuration
- [ ] Vector extension support verified and configured
- [ ] Initial database migration structure established
- [ ] Connection pooling and performance settings configured
- [ ] Database health checks implemented
- [ ] Environment-specific configuration (dev/test/prod)

## Technical Details

### Database Configuration
- Configure PostgreSQL instance with vector extension support
- Set up connection strings for different environments
- Configure Entity Framework Core with PostgreSQL provider
- Implement database context with proper entity configurations

### Migration Strategy
- Create initial migration structure
- Set up versioning system for database schema changes
- Implement rollback capabilities for migrations
- Configure migration execution in different environments

### Performance Considerations
- Configure connection pooling with appropriate limits
- Set up proper indexing strategy for embedding operations
- Configure timeout settings for long-running queries
- Implement database health monitoring

### Security Setup
- Configure database authentication and authorization
- Set up encrypted connections (SSL/TLS)
- Implement proper user roles and permissions
- Configure backup and recovery procedures

## Dependencies
- PostgreSQL server installation and setup
- Entity Framework Core NuGet packages
- Vector extension availability (pgvector or similar)
- HippoCamp infrastructure setup

## Effort Estimate
**Size**: Medium (M)  
**Hours**: 16-20 hours  
**Complexity**: Moderate - involves infrastructure setup and configuration

## Definition of Done
- PostgreSQL database is running and accessible
- Entity Framework Core successfully connects to database
- Vector extensions are installed and functional
- Initial migrations can be created and applied
- Database health checks pass in all environments
- Configuration is environment-agnostic and follows HippoCamp patterns
- All connection and performance settings are properly documented
- Database setup can be replicated in different environments
