# Task 009: API Documentation and Deployment

## Description
Generate comprehensive OpenAPI specifications, create detailed usage documentation with examples, and establish deployment configurations and guides for the memory-store service. This task completes the service delivery by providing all necessary documentation and deployment artifacts for production use.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] OpenAPI 3.0 specification generated from API controllers
- [ ] Interactive API documentation (Swagger UI) accessible
- [ ] Comprehensive usage documentation with code examples
- [ ] Authentication and authorization documentation
- [ ] Error handling and troubleshooting guides
- [ ] Performance guidelines and optimization tips
- [ ] Deployment configuration files for different environments
- [ ] Container images and Docker configurations
- [ ] Infrastructure as Code templates (if applicable)
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting setup documentation
- [ ] Backup and disaster recovery procedures
- [ ] API versioning and migration strategies

## Technical Details

### API Documentation
- Configure Swagger/OpenAPI generation from controller attributes
- Add comprehensive XML documentation to all endpoints
- Include request/response examples for all operations
- Document authentication requirements and token usage
- Create interactive documentation with try-it functionality
- Generate client SDKs for common programming languages

### Usage Documentation
- Write getting-started guide with setup instructions
- Create code examples for common use cases
- Document embedding format requirements and best practices
- Provide search operation examples with filtering
- Include project isolation setup and usage
- Create troubleshooting guides for common issues

### Deployment Artifacts
- Create Dockerfile with multi-stage builds for optimization
- Configure environment-specific appsettings files
- Set up health check configurations for orchestrators
- Create database migration deployment scripts
- Configure logging and monitoring for production
- Set up security configurations and best practices

### Infrastructure Documentation
- Document system requirements and dependencies
- Create deployment guides for different environments
- Document scaling considerations and performance tuning
- Include monitoring setup and dashboard configuration
- Create disaster recovery and backup procedures
- Document security hardening recommendations

### Developer Resources
- Create API client examples in multiple languages
- Document local development setup procedures
- Include testing strategies and best practices
- Create contribution guidelines for future development
- Document architectural decisions and design patterns

## Dependencies
- Aspire integration and monitoring setup (Task 007)
- Complete API implementation from previous tasks
- Production-ready service configuration
- HippoCamp deployment infrastructure
- Documentation tooling and templates

## Effort Estimate
**Size**: Medium (M)  
**Hours**: 16-20 hours  
**Complexity**: Moderate - documentation and configuration rather than complex development

## Definition of Done
- OpenAPI specification accurately describes all API endpoints
- Interactive documentation is accessible and functional
- Usage documentation covers all major use cases with working examples
- Deployment configurations work across development, staging, and production
- Docker images build successfully and run in container environments
- All documentation is up-to-date and accurately reflects current implementation
- Performance guidelines are validated and documented
- Security configurations follow industry best practices
- Backup and recovery procedures are tested and documented
- Documentation follows HippoCamp standards and conventions
